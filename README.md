# Website
 This is the source code for the website at [https://www.plotzes.ml](https://www.plotzes.ml). It is mostly centred around getting TNT Games information. You can join the Discord server ([https://www.plotzes.ml/discord](https://www.plotzes.ml/discord)) if you want to be notified about updates, report errors, make suggestion, discuss TNT Games and much more. The following pages are available on my site:
 - Home
 - TNT Games

## Home
 [Link](https://www.plotzes.ml)  
 This is the main page. It's still in development so there's not much to see right now.

 ### Stats
 [Link](https://www.plotzes.ml/stats)
 This page shows you a neat overview of someone's account. It gives you a small profile card at the right hand side with information such as their first and last login time, network level and XP information, daily reward information and much more. It also has seven collapsibles with general TNT Games stats, per game stats and Minecraft account stats. The TNT Wizards collapsibles has an incredible useful table of all stats per class.

 <i>Example of table</i>

 In the TNT Games collapsible you can find a lot of stats about the TNT Games as a whole. This includes their selected cosmetics, winstreak and playtime for example.
 The Minecraft account collapsible has information about the Minecraft account itself, so not related to Hypixel in any way. A few of the things you can find here is their UUID, if they have a custom skin and their username history for example.

 ### Player count
 [Link](https://www.plotzes.ml/playercount)  
 This page will show you the current amount of players who are playing TNT Games in total, and each game separately. It has a zoomable chart that shows the history of each game up to 48h back.

 ### Images
  [Link](https://www.plotzes.ml/images)  
  This page explains the dynamic image service I'm providing. Dynamic images are images which shows you the stats of a user based on the URL of the image. The stats in the picture get automatically updated when the image is loading. It does use server-side caching so the stats might be a few hours behind but never more than 24 hours. You can use these links to get an image in your forum signature that is always up to date with your stats.

 ### Wizards Leaderboard
 [Link](https://www.plotzes.ml/leaderboard)  
 Every player who gets entered in the [stats page](https://plotzes.ml/stats) with TNT Wizards stats will get added to the leaderboard. It currently has over 6,200 entries. You can order the leaderboard based on different TNT Wizards stats. Currently you can order by the following stats:
  - Wizards Wins (default)
  - Total Kills
  - Total Assists
  - Total Deaths
  - Veteran Kills
  - Captured Points
  - Airtime
  - Kill Death Ratio
  - Ancient Kills
  - Blood Kills
  - Fire Kills
  - Hydro Kills
  - Ice Kills
  - Kinetic Kills
  - Storm Kills
  - Toxic Kills
  - Wither Kills
  - Plotzes Rating

 The leaderboard is a table that exists of four columns. The first column is a number that shows you the rank of the player. The second column is the player name. If you click on the name then you will go to their stats page. The third column will show the select stat from the selector. The fourth, and last, column shows you the time since their last update. If you want to update someone's position on the leaderboard then you only have to go to their stats page. Every minute, 3 people are updated automatically. They're the 3 players that were updated the longest ago. This means that, with ~6,300 entries, a full update rotation happens every 1 day and 11 hours or so.
