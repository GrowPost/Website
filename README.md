# Website
 This is the source code for the website at https://plotzes.ml. It is mostly centred around getting TNT Wizards information. The following pages are available:

## Home

 This is the main page. It's still in development so there's not much to see right now.

 ### Stats
 [Link](https://plotzes.ml/stats)  
 This page shows you a neat overview of someone's account. It gives you a small profile card at the right hand side with information such as their first and last login time, network level and XP information, daily reward information and much more. It also has three collapsibles with information about Wizards stats, TNT Games stats and Minecraft account stats. The Wizards stats page has an incredible useful table of all stats per class.

 <i>Example of table</i>

 In the TNT Games collapsible you can find a lot of stats about the TNT Games as a whole. This includes their selected cosmetics, winstreak and playtime for example.
 The Minecraft account collapsible has information about the Minecraft account itself, so not related to Hypixel in any way. A few of the things you can find here is their UUID, if they have a custom skin and their username history for example.

 ### Player count
 [Link](https://plotzes.ml/wizcount)  
 This page will show you the current amount of players who are playing TNT Wizards. It will also show you the player count history recorded at the database nearest to you in a neat resizable graph.

 ### Leaderboard
 [Link](https://plotzes.ml/leaderboard)  
 Every player who gets entered in the [stats page](https://plotzes.ml/stats) with TNT Wizards stats will get added to the leaderboard. It currently has over 3,200 entries. You can order the leaderboard based on different TNT Wizards stats. Currently you can order by the following stats:
  - Wizards Wins (default)
  - Total Kills
  - Total Assists
  - Total Deaths
  - Captured Points
  - Airtime
  - Kill Death Ratio
  - Ancient Kills
  - Blood Kills
  - Fire Kills
  - Hydro Kills
  - Ice Kills
  - Kinetic Kills
  - Storm Kills
  - Toxic Kills
  - Wither Kills
  - Plotzes Rating

 The leaderboard is a table that exists of four columns. The first column is a number that shows you the rank of the player. The second column is the player name. If you click on the name then you will go to their stats page. The third column will show the select stat from the selector. The fourth, and last, column shows you the time since their last update. If you want to update someone's position on the leaderboard then you only have to go to their stats page. Every minute 20 people are updated automatically. They're the 20 players that were updated the longest ago. This means that, with ~3,300 entries, a full update rotation happens every 2h and 45m or so.
