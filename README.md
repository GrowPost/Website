 ### Leaderboard
 [Link](https://www.plotzes.ml/leaderboard)  
 Every player who gets entered in the [stats page](https://plotzes.ml/stats) with TNT Wizards stats will get added to the leaderboard. It currently has over 2.700 entries. You can order the leaderboard based on different TNT Wizards stats. Currently you can order by the following stats:
  - Wizards Wins (default)
  - Total Kills
  - Total Assists
  - Total Deaths
  - Captured Points
  - Airtime
  - Kill Death Ratio
  - Ancient Kills
  - Blood Kills
  - Fire Kills
  - Hydro Kills
  - Ice Kills
  - Kinetic Kills
  - Storm Kills
  - Toxic Kills
  - Wither Kills
  - Plotzes Rating


 The leaderboard is a table that exists of four columns. The first column is a number that shows you the rank of the player. The second column is the player name. If you click on the name then you will go to their stats page. The third column will show the select stat from the selector. The fourth, and last, column shows you the time since their last update. If you want to update someone's position on the leaderboard then you only have to go to their stats page. Every 30 minutes, between 12:00 UTC and 23:59 UTC, it will automatically update the stats of the five players who've been updated the longest ago.
