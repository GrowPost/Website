            <p>I really love toxic. Like, a lot. Like, a whole lot. You have no idea. I love toxic so much that it is inexplicable, and I'm ninety-nine percent sure that I have an unhealthy obsession. I will never get tired of one shotting people from behind. It is my life goal to play an unkillable class and just run away whenever I feel slightly threatened. I fall asleep at night dreaming of playing toxic and holding a point, and then I wake up and realize the class I main is fucking useless. If I could just hold a point for a brief moment, I could die happy. If given the opportunity, I would shoot someone from behind while they type, just to watch the world fucking burn. Then, I would run away to spawnâ€¦ while they pursue, hoping that I would stop, but I only continue as their rage burns hotter and hotter. I would give up almost anything just for toxic to just be a viable class. No matter what I do, I am constantly thinking of toxic. When I wake up, toxic is the first thing on my mind. When I go to school, I can only focus on toxic. When I come home, I go on the computer so that I can see its beautiful class icon. When I go to sleep, I dream of double-teaming people and shit talking. I rest happily. Toxic is my pride, passion, and joy. If a kinetic non were to call me "hacker," I would probably get diabetes from their sweetness and die. I wish for nothing but all toxic players' happiness. If it were for them, I would give my life without any second thoughts. Without them, my life would serve no purpose. I really love toxic.</p>
